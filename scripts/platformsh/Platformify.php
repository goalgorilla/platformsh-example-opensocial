/**
 * @file Platform-ifying script for Drupal 8.
 *
 * The purpose of this script is to reapply the Platform.sh customizations for
 * Drupal 8, Composer-Edition.  It is based on the Drupal-Composer project.
 *
 * Because Platform.sh requires a read-only file system, the initial snapshot
 * that is used for creating a project MUST be able to run without disk
 * modification.  For that reason, we cannot simply use the Drupal-Composer
 * project directly as both it and the normal Drupal installer need to write to
 * the settings.php file.  The alternative is to check only the web directory
 * into Git, including the Platform.sh-specific settings.php and
 * settings.platformsh.php files.
 *
 * The only files in this repository that should be directly updated are:
 *
 * - This script, if necessary, but probably not.
 * - scripts/platformsh/dist.settings.php, which will overwrite the default Drupal
 *   settings.php file.  Users may customize this file for their particular
 *   sites.
 * - scripts/platformsh/dist.settings.platformsh.php, which is common to all
 *   projects and should generally not be updated. It maps Platform.sh's
 *   environment variables to Drupal database credentials, $settings, and so
 *   forth.
 * - .platform.app.yaml and .platform/*, which provide the Platform.sh-endorsed
 *   example configuration for a Drupal 8 site.
 *
 * To update this starter kit when a new release of Drupal, or a new release of
 * the Drupal-Composer project, is available, do the following on a separate
 * branch:
 *
 * git remote add dc git@github.com:drupal-composer/drupal-project.git
 * sh scripts/platformsh/update_upstream.sh
 * git commit -m "Your message here"
 *
